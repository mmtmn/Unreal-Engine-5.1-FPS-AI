#  Unreal-Engine-5.1-FPS-AI

This AI uses a controller class (UFPSAIController) to handle targeting and decision making, and the AI itself (FPSAI) handles movement and other behaviors. The AI moves towards its target enemy at a specified speed. You can customize the AI's behavior by modifying the Tick function and adding additional functionality to the controller class.
